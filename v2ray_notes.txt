Basic technique is you run the VMESS protocol (improved shadowsocks), but then encrypt that 
in TLS, and put it behind Cloudflare or whatever.

Nginx runs on the VPS, and Cloudflare forwards the traffic to it over this.  It proxies 
traffic for a specific path (/info in this case) to the local v2ray process listening on 
127.0.0.1:<port> in plaintext.  The v2ray daemon then decodes the vmess encoded proxy 
request, and sends the actual request out on the internet.
